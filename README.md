# General ODE and Physics Simulation

The file General_ODE.py provides a general user interface for solving k-th order coupled ODE with n parameters.

Initial condition problems are solved by the function IC_ODE where the Runge-Kutta algorithm is implemented.
Boundary problems are solved by the function BC_ODE where the shooting method is implemented.
